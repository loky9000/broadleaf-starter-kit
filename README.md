### How Does this Kit Work?

Broadleaf Starter Kit has three main components:

* **Broadleaf Demo site** - The Heat Clinic eCommerce store.
* **Broadleaf admin panel** - The Administration Panel  for easy  Broadleaf catalog management.
* **Solr Cloud Search Engine** - A search engine that indexes and executes search queries from Broadleaf catalog.
   By default Broadleaf use embeded Solr support. But in our demo  we setup  a full Solr cluster - 4 nodes 2 shards with Zookeeper ensemble - 3 nodes.
   We use our fork Broadleaf DemoSite [https://github.com/qubell-bazaar/DemoSite](https://github.com/qubell-bazaar/DemoSite).It contain:
      -  preconfigured archive with solr collection files  
      -  changed sources for support mysql and solr cloud
